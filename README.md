# Diabetes Prediction

This project is an exploration in discovering ways a person can get diabetes. It's not just how and what to predict, but also what might be causing diabetes, so we can give further instructions to the patient. I am trying to make the notebook as explainable as possible, by doing EDA in the beginning to find possible causes of diabetes and then comparing the feature importance of each model. As you can see, both the EDA and feature importance aligned. \

The data for this project is obtained from kaggle, which is already a little bit cleaned, it's just heavily imbalanced. The jupyter notebook details my steps on handling with this issue. It also has various data visualization techniques to better see and understand the data. \

Note that a Machine Learning algorithm will NEVER replace a real doctor (please seek actual medical help).
